## Task 1: Single Number Finder

**Description:** Find the duplicated number in an array where every other element appears once.

**Method Signature:**

```java
int singleNumber(int[] nums)
```

## Task 2: Coin Splitter

**Description:** Calculate the minimum number of coins required to represent a given amount using coin denominations of
1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 tetri.

**Method Signature:**

```java
int minSplit(int amount)
```

## Task 3: Minimum Not Contained Integer

**Description:** Find the smallest positive integer that is not present in an array of integers.

**Method Signature:**

```java
int notContains(int[] array)
```

## Task 4: Binary String Addition

**Description:** Add two binary strings and return the result as a binary string.

**Method Signature:**

```java
String addBinary(String a, String b)
```

## Task 5: Stairs Variants Calculator

**Description:** Calculate the number of ways to climb a staircase with `n` steps, where you can either take 1 or 2
steps at a time.

**Method Signature:**

```java
int countVariants(int stairsCount)
```

## Task 6: Efficient Element Removal

**Description:** Implement a data structure that allows for the efficient removal of an element in O(1) time.

## Usage

Each task's solution is implemented in a separate Java class within the `org.example` package. JUnit test classes are
also provided for each task to ensure the correctness of the solutions. You can run the tests to verify the
functionality of the solutions.
